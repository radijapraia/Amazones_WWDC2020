 Hello! My name is Radija Praia. I'm from Amazonas. I have a degree in Business and, in search of a new direction that makes sense in this world, currently I am studying Computer Engineering. I'm learning to develop software starting by Swift in Playground and I'm loving it. Among the collections of my life's passions, I share a latent one: retain and pass on knowledge. Knowledge is liberating. Transformation, self-knowledge and empathy start from knowledge.
